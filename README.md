# Emotune: AI-Powered Adaptive Music Therapy

**Emotune** is a real-time emotion-responsive system that combines facial and vocal emotion analysis with adaptive music generation. The goal is to explore AI-driven music therapy applications to support mental well-being by responding to users' affective states dynamically.

## Overview

Emotune captures and analyzes emotional signals through facial expressions and vocal tone, interprets the user's current affective state (valence, arousal, and discrete emotion), and interfaces with a music generation engine to adapt sound output in real time. The system is modular, enabling independent upgrades to perception and synthesis components.
